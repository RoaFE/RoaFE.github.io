Spooky Game made for the Abertay Game Development Society spooky jam
Created in Unity and programmed in C#. Made in a few hours for the Abertay Game Development Society&#39;s spooky game jam for halloween. I was in charge of the majority of mechanics not that there was many.

<div class="PageContent">
<p>A really small game that is about the classic horror trope of the door always slamming behind the player. I was responsible for camera, movement, door slamming, door following and the end state.</p>

    <p>The inspiration came from the trope in horrors where the door always slams closed when someone goes to leave / look at it. We took that and decided to make a game where the player walks down a corridor with a door that follows them, everytime they turn around the door would SLAM shut and stay in place so long as the player looks at it. The second they look away it will re-open and teleport behind them and begine to follow them again.</p>
    <p>Made to meet the following diversifies :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game can be completed in 60 seconds</li>
        <li>Player only using the space bar</li>
        <li>The art only consists of 4 colours</li>
        <li>All audio assets are made with our mouths</li>
        <li>The player can only move forward</li>
