<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="PostHeaderContent">
A suite of games to accompany a prototype medical device to help patients with their prescribed exercises.
Created in Unity and programmed in C# for android tablets. In brief I was responsible for the creation of various games to work with a prototype medical device. Along with implementing these game I had to record the data outputted by the device and graph them in game. Additionally a proof of concept accompanying dashboard was created for clinicians to be paired with the suite of games.

<h2> Summary </h2>
<p>Since this project uses proprietary experimental technology created by the client the details of the project need to be confidential until it's released to market.</p>
<h2> The Game </h2>
<h3> Mini Games </h3>
<p>I made several simple mini games for this project. The most complex of the games was based around syncing the procedural generation of content in the game to a variety of  music tracks created by the client. To achieve this I had to make sure the BPM synced up to the gameplay and the different phases of the songs lined up with the phases of the game. To achieve this I created a timing manager that took the BPM and song durations as inputs and from that it could invoke the different gameplay elements as needed. </p>
<h3> Data recording </h3>
<p>Values out putted by the device had to be recorded and uploaded to a firebase database as well as graphed in game. I created a generic data recorder that had helper functions to call the relevant firebase API functions. The client wanted the data recording to be as granular as possible while trying to balance read / write calls and the size of the database. Databases are no where near my strong suit but this was an excellent learning experience with regards to them.
<h2>The Dashboard </h2>
<p>On the other end the client wanted a dashboard that could pull the data recorded by the device and games. This dashboard would be used by clinicians to examine the progress of the patients. While I was solely responsible for my work on the games the dashboard was a team project.</p>
<h2>The Clients</h2>
<p>Since most of the project revolved around the games and for the most part I was the only team member on this project I had a lot of calls with the clients. This meant I had regular conversations with the client through the format of video calls and emails. The nature of these communications typically involved updating progress, discussing proposed changes, discussing and fixing issues with builds and ensuring client satisfaction with our work.</p>
