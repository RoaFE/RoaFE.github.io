Fun side project experimenting with the layering of waves
Created in C++ with SFML a simple visualiser of waves that propogate around a circle.

<p>During my graphics project in third year I propagated a wave round a sphere. I really enjoyed the way the sphere moved and changed depending on the values you set. I wanted to continue something along these lines so I created something similar in 2D but now with the added ability to add multiple waves. This can visualise constructive and deconstruction interference. </p>

<p>I created it using SFML in C++ and it works by procedurally constructying a circle each frame. This circle calculates the position vertices based on the wave information defined by the user in the program. </p>
<p>It is still a work in progress but my plans for the project were to eventually add sounds and key presses that send single waves through the circle like a note being played on a key board for example. I also wished to move the processing from the CPU to the GPU through the use of a vertex shader. Sadly I ended up shelving the project but may come back and do more with it one day.</p>
