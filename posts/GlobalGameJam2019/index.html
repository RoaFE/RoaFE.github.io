    <p>I partook in the 2019 Global game jam where the theme was home. The team I was a part of came up with a game about a bird trying to decorate their nest. The aim was to try let the player have freedom when it came to customising the nest and for the player to decide when their nest is complete.</p>

    <p>I mainly worked on the random spawning of objects, trees and rocks to create a different experience every time, picking up and dropping of objects and the camera movement as well as having some input into the moving between game scenes.</p>
