        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p>Hey welcome to my portfolio, if you're reading this then I'm guessing you want to get to get to know a bit about me. I'm a Games programmer from Scotland working at Konglomerate Games and have been for the past 2 year. A timeline of my formal experience can be found just next this. I love learning and experimenting and have had a blast learning more and getting a chance to apply my knowledge in a professional setting. I'm into more than just programming though, in my spare time I like to hike, boulder and recently have been getting into baking. I'm happy to chat, or if you have any questions feel free to <a href="mailto:r.stockton06@gmail.com">contact me!</a></p>
