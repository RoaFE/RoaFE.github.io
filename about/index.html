            Hey welcome to my little slice of the internet, I'm a general Games Programmer currently working at Konglomerate Games and have been working here since 2021. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A timeline of my formal experience can be found below which goes into my technical skills and the journey I have been on. I love learning and experimenting and have had a blast learning more and getting a chance to apply my knowledge in a professional setting. I work on some projects in my spare time every now and then and at the moment have been working on a game about high-fiving which may end up in my personal project section. Particular enjoyments of mine within the context of Games are Physics and Maths.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm into more than just programming though, in my spare time I like to watch movies, hike, boulder and I LOVE baking espeically bread, so much so I may add a bread page to this website. I'm happy to chat, or if you have any questions feel free to <a href="mailto:r.stockton06@gmail.com">contact me!</a>
